## 3.6.0
* Lightning Core now supports attaching pictures to user accounts, and includes
  a Compact display which displays the user's picture and name, both optionally
  linked to the user's profile. (Issue #3026959)
* Lightning Core now includes a "Long (12-hour)" date format, which formats
  dates and times like "April 1, 2019 at 4:20 PM".
* Fixed a bug where Lightning's utility to convert descendant profiles to the
  Drupal 8.6-compatible format would fail if the active profile was itself a
  descendant profile. (Issue #2997990)
* Fixed an "undefined index" bug that could happen when processing form
  elements which can have legends. (Issue #3018499)
* Namespaced all declared dependencies. (Issue #2995711)
