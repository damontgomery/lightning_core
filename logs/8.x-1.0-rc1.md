## 1.0.0-rc1
* The `update:lightning` command can now be run using either Drupal Console or
  Drush 9.
* Component version numbers are now recorded on install (and via an update hook
  on existing installations) so that the `version` argument is no longer needed
  with the `update:lightning` command.
